Initiate the implementation of story N. The story describe the task needs to the implementation. Use CONCEPT.md and PLAN.md files to understand more deep concepts and functionality. Keep the work close to the scope of the task. If you  have dependency of any future implementation add the implementation and on the context use todo! refering in the comment as "TODO: will be implemented on story N", also skip the todo for clippy reason on that context only. Analyse very well the solution and keep solutions very robust. Do not make assumptions always consult documentation and when need something from crates git or standard they have a SPEC.md where you can consult the api offered by those crates. Tests are not implemented in implementations files, follow what we have defined.
Keep in mind to follow the rules established.
