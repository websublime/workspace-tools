As a Senior software developer initiate the implementation of story 5.2. The story describe the task needs to the implementation. Read PLAN.md and PRD.md files to understand more deep the concepts and functionality, this is MANDATORY todo before creating anything. Keep the work close to the scope of the task. If you  have dependency of any future implementation add the implementation and on the context use todo! refering in the comment as "TODO: will be implemented on story N", also skip the todo for clippy reason on that context only. Analyse very well the solution and keep solutions very robust. Do not make assumptions always consult documentation and when need something from crates git or standard they have a SPEC.md where you can consult the api offered by those crates. Tests are not implemented in implementations files, follow what we have defined, each module as a tests.rs file and tests are grouped inside. PLAN.md and PRD.md are the source of true, solutions should be robust and professional. Check if are pending todos for the current implementation and also what already is defined. For human output use the modern and minimal output we made it.
