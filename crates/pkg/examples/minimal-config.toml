# Minimal Package Tools Configuration
# This example shows the absolute minimum configuration needed.
# All settings use their default values, so you only need to customize what differs.

# For most projects, you can start with this minimal configuration and add
# settings as needed. The library works out of the box with sensible defaults.

[package_tools.changeset]
# Only specify if you want a different path
# path = ".changesets"

[package_tools.version]
# Only specify if you want unified versioning instead of independent
# strategy = "unified"

[package_tools.changelog]
# Only specify if you have a repository URL for link generation
# repository_url = "https://github.com/org/repo"

# That's it! Everything else will use sensible defaults.
# Run with default configuration by simply not providing a config file,
# or customize specific sections as your project grows.

# Common customizations you might add later:
#
# For scoped package registries:
# [package_tools.upgrade.registry.scoped]
# "@myorg" = "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
#
# For multiple deployment environments:
# [package_tools.changeset]
# available_environments = ["development", "staging", "production"]
# default_environments = ["production"]
#
# For unified versioning in monorepos:
# [package_tools.version]
# strategy = "unified"
#
# For custom changelog format:
# [package_tools.changelog]
# format = "conventional"
# monorepo_mode = "both"
